      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way: 
    </p>
    <ul>
	<li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
	<li>Magic City, ID</li>
	<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
	<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
      	<li>Why, AZ</li>
	<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
    </ul>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars, <br>
      When you can't see, <br>
      May get you, <br>
      A glimpse, <br>
      Of eternity. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <p> 
	I definitely won't be passing any cars.

      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod,
      digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway."
